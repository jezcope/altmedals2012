# Alternative medal tables

The olympic medal table is always sorted by gold first, then by silver, then by bronze. But what happens if we sort it in different ways?

* [Standard medal table](/standard)
* [Sorted by total](/total)
* [Sorted with weights 3/2/1](/weighted/3/2/1)
* [Sorted with weights 4/2/1](/weighted/4/2/1)
